This is a website I made with Gatsby to test out Netlify CMS as a technology to host a blog that may be incorporated into the V School website. The rationale behind using Netlify CMS was to make it easy to add or change data on the site even for non-developers, since they can add it on the Netlify CMS site rather than having to touch the source code.

The site is very basic, but allowed me to practice using Gatsby (including creating slugs to be used as templates for future blog posts) and Layout elements for adding headers and footers by writing them once and using them where I chose (the home and about pages).

It also allowed me to get more experience with CSS modules (or, in this case, SCSS) for designing CSS layouts for pages that require their own styling (in this case, the blog page).
